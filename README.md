This study aims to implement a DT to simulate various operating conditions, analyze performance, and predict potential failures of HVAC as it responds to increase in indoor temperature as a result of increase in LST. We used Python codes to simulate a DT of the HVAC in Nigerian Institution of Surveyors (NIS) building and study the impact of temperature rise on energy use in the building.
